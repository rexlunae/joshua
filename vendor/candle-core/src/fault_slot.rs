//! Per-thread fault slots for the accelerator backends.
//!
//! An indexing kernel cannot return an error, so on an out-of-range id it
//! sets a word in the device's fault buffer, which the host checks and
//! clears at the next read-back or `synchronize`.  One device serves every
//! request of a server at once, so a single shared word would let one
//! thread's fault be consumed (or erased) by another's read-back.  Each
//! thread therefore owns one slot of the buffer for its lifetime: a
//! request's launches and its read-backs happen on the same thread, so the
//! error reaches the request that caused it and nobody else.
//!
//! Slots come from a fixed pool (the buffer holds [`SLOTS`] words); a
//! thread that starts after the pool is exhausted shares slot 0, which
//! degrades to the device-wide word rather than failing.
//!
//! A slot is recycled when its thread exits.  Launches are asynchronous,
//! so before the number goes back to the pool every live device *drains*
//! it: it completes the work it has queued and clears the word (see
//! [`register_drain`]).  A later owner therefore never inherits a fault
//! raised by a kernel the previous owner left in flight.
